# LightEmAll Overview
## Description
LightEmAll is an engaging puzzle game that challenges players to connect all nodes in a grid using wires to illuminate the entire board.

## Features

- Minimum Spanning Tree Generation: Utilizes Kruskal's algorithm to construct a minimum spanning tree, ensuring a single valid path connects all nodes efficiently.
- Power-Up Mechanism: Introduces a dynamic gameplay experience through a power-up mechanism employed by Breadth-First Search (BFS) to illuminate wires connected to the power station.
- Random Board Generation: Provides a fresh challenge in every playthrough with randomly generated boards, adding to the game's replay value.
